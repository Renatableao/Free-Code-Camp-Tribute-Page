            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p class="">back to menu</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">S</span>he was born Annelies Marie Frank on June 12, 1929, in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. 
                    Her parents were Otto and Edith Frank. For the first 5 years of her life, Anne lived with her parents and older 
                    sister, Margot, in an apartment on the outskirts of Frankfurt.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">U</span>nemployment was high and poverty was severe in Germany, and it was the period in which 
                    Adolf Hitler and his party were gaining more and more supporters. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Otto Frank 
                    fled to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, where he had business connections. The rest of the Frank family soon followed, 
                    with Anne being the last of the family to arrive in February 1934 after staying with her grandparents in Aachen. She 
                    learned the language, made new friends and went to a Dutch school near her home. Her father worked hard to get his 
                    business off the ground, but it was not easy. Otto also tried to set up a company in England, but the plan fell through. 
                    Things looked up when he started selling herbs and spices in addition to the pectin.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">O</span>n 1 September 1939, when Anne was 10 years old, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, and so the 
                    Second World War began. Not long after, on 10 May 1940, the Nazis also invaded the Netherlands. Five days later, the 
                    Dutch army surrendered. Slowly but surely, the Nazis introduced more and more laws and regulations that made the lives 
                    of Jews more difficult.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n 1941, after German forces occupied the Netherlands, Anne was compelled to transfer from 
                    a public school to a Jewish one. On June 12, 1942, she received a red-and-white plaid diary for her 13th birthday. That 
                    day she began writing in the book: <blockquote>“I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been 
                    able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support.”</blockquote></p>               
            <p><span class="first-letter">W</span>hen Margot received a call-up to report for a so-called "labour camp" in Nazi Germany on 5 
                    July 1942, her parents were suspicious. They did not believe the call-up was about work and decided to go into hiding the 
                    next day in order to escape persecution. The Franks went into hiding on July 6, 1942, in the backroom office and warehouse 
                    of Otto Frank’s food-products business. With the aid of a few non-Jewish friends, among them Miep Gies, who smuggled in 
                    food and other supplies, the Frank family and four other Jews — Hermann and Auguste van Pels and their son, Peter, and Fritz 
                    Pfeffer — lived confined to the <b>“secret annex.”</b></p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">D</span>uring the two years in hiding, Anne wrote about events in the Secret Annex, but also about her 
                    feelings and thoughts. In addition, she wrote short stories, started on a novel and copied passages from the books she read 
                    in her Book of Beautiful Sentences. Writing helped her pass the time. Anne’s last diary entry was written on August 1, 1944.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">A</span>nne started rewriting her diary, but before she was done, she and the other people in hiding were 
                    discovered and arrested by police officers on 4 August 1944. The police also arrested two of the helpers. To this day, it is not 
                    known the reason for the police raid.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Frank family was transported to Westerbork, a transit camp in the Netherlands, and from there 
                    to Auschwitz, in German-occupied Poland, on September 3, 1944, on the last transport to leave Westerbork for Auschwitz. Anne 
                    and Margot were transferred to Bergen-Belsen the following month.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">A</span>nne’s mother died in early January, just before the evacuation of Auschwitz on January 18, 1945. 
                    It was established by the Dutch government that both Anne and Margot died in a typhus epidemic in March 1945, only weeks before
                    the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, but scholars in 2015 revealed new research, including analysis of archival data and first-person 
                    accounts, indicating that the sisters might have perished in February 1945. Otto Frank was found hospitalized at Auschwitz when 
                    it was liberated by Soviet troops on January 27, 1945.</p>
            <p><span class="first-letter">O</span>tto was presented later with Anne’s writings, which were preserved by Miep Gies one of the Dutch 
                    citizens who had hidden the Franks. Otto Frank was integral to getting his daughter’s diary published. The book was later 
                    translated into around 70 languages and adapted for stage and screen. People all over the world were introduced to Anne's story 
                    and in 1960 the hiding place became a museum: the Anne Frank House.</p>
